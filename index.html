      <h2 style="font-size: xx-large">Hello There!</h2>
      <p>
        This website presents information on some of the topics that I find
        interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm convinced that the topics covered on this website, if solved or
        developed further, has the potential to make the world a better place.
        Specifically in terms of quality of life (perhaps
        <a
          href="https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/human-development-index#/indicies/HDI"
          >HDI</a
        >
        is a reasonable proxy), and allowing humans to progress to a more
        technologically advanced and humane civilisation. There are many such
        topics, but I've narrowed down to a few that I am most passionate about
        at this stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        For scientific or engineering challenges, I try to approach the topic
        from first principles, and cover as many branches as I could for the
        “what-if”/”how about” scenarios, to ensure that every possible avenue
        for solving a problem is explored.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Intent</h2>
      <p>
        My hope is that the content here serves the audience in such a way that
        it inspires them to contribute to the field. Again, for scientific or
        engineering challenges, I suspect that breakthroughs may come through
        old ideas that were discarded due to limitations in the past whose
        re-evaluation today may make it attractive given the technological and
        scientific progress in other areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        While there are many excellent resources (some of which I reference in
        the content) on these topics, I wanted to present the topics freely, in
        a manner I prefer, and interlace some of my personal thoughts or
        annotations where appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another intent of this effort is to help me better understand the topics
        myself, by presenting it to others (Learning by teaching).
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Website layout and implementation</h2>
      <h3>Navigation Links</h3>
      <p>
        The navigation links at the top take you to the home-page for the
        topics. The content is arranged in a hierarchical manner (tree),
        generally, so the navigation links below should help guide with intended
        flow of content consumption. However, this is a subjective preference,
        and you can use the table of contents to serve you the way you desire.
        There may be multiple tables of contents, where the hierarchy is
        arranged differently (categorised perhaps by areas of physics,
        reliability of information, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
        The vast majority of the website content is just html and css, with the
        intent to widen reach and minimise distractions from the content.
        Calculators and scripts may be present on certain pages, for
        demonstration or educational purposes.
      </p>
      <h3>Font Style:</h3>
      You can usually distinguish between conventionally accepted information
      and the author's annotations/opinion/speculation by checking the
      references or links. Some of the content is explicitly marked with
      different font styles to help distinguish between the two.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Derived from a collection of authoritative sources and conveying
          conventionally accepted information.
        </li>
        <li class="opinion">
          The author&rsquo;s subjective opinions, newly published research or
          content with low confidence on accuracy.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Collapsible Sections:</h3>
      <p>
        There may be collapsible sections that provide more details on a topic.
        The intent here is to provide the reader with the choice of abstraction
        of detail. Detailed information, including any mathematical equations
        and links to related content are generally included in collapsible
        sections.
