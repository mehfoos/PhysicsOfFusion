          <b>Figure:</b> Almost every human source of energy is derived
          ultimately from the sun, which runs on Fusion. Major advances to our
          civilisation on earth or beyond probably requires more than just
          sun-dependent renewable energy. (Image Source: NASA)

      <p>
        Nuclear fusion, the process powering the sun and stars, has long been
        touted as a silver bullet to humanity’s energy crisis with potential to
        also accelerate human development, reduce energy resource conflicts and
        tackle global warming. However, it has remained elusive for decades as a
        commercially feasible solution due to long-standing challenges and
        concerns, including whether it will ever be a practically viable and
        competitive source of commercial energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leaving aside the question of <i>how</i>, if we can implement a
        commercially feasible nuclear fusion reactor within the confines of the
        physics we know today, it would accelerate human development. The main
        reasoning for that line of thinking is attributed to the abundance of
        the fuel and enormous energy density advantage over other sources of
        energy.
      </p>
      <details>
        <summary>More</summary>
        <p>
          The fuel in question can alter this reasoning. Currently, the leading
          candidate is Deuterium and Tritium (hydrogen isotopes with 2 and 3
          neutrons in the atomic nucleus respectively), for which Tritium seems
          to be rare and challenging to source. Even so, the reactor design
          proposals often incorporate a tritium breeding design from a more
          commonly available element (the most common scheme involving what’s
          essentially nuclear fission of a Lithium isotope using the neutron
          particle produced in the Deuterium-Tritium reaction). It is also
          thought that technology will evolve to other reactions later, which
          reduces this dependency, but that involves more uncertainty in
          forecasts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The energy density advantage mostly boils down to Einstein’s famous
          (E=mc^2) mass-energy equivalence, and since the mass “lost” is
          relatively high in the candidate nuclear fusion reactors, they are
          often many orders of magnitude more energy dense as a fuel compared to
          chemical reactions. For practical purposes, the density should take
          into consideration the entire reactor, which may be lower but the
          thought is that the potential entitlement is attractive to make it a
          worthwhile pursuit.

      <h3>The Author's take on it:</h3>
      <p class="opinion">
        Some of the scepticism is driven by the fact that optimism in the past
        failed to materialise, leading to the cliche declaration, "Nuclear
        Fusion is always <i>x</i> years away". I appreciate this, and it is a
        matter of fact that many of the predictions about nuclear fusion in the
        past were, in hindsight, hopelessly unrealistic. There are also a great
        many technological, commercial and political challenges today, some of
        which seem challenging enough for some veterans in the field to conclude
        that it's a lost cause.
      </p>
      <p class="opinion">
        It may very well be a lost cause, but I'm not convinced yet that
        "Argument from Authority" settles the matter. The field of nuclear
        science has witnessed this before, with Rutherford and Millikan,
        pioneers in the field, who went on the express harsh scepticism about
        atomic energy ever being harnessed by humans. They were in good company,
        as so did Einstein. It did not take long for them to be proven wrong,
        but that was likely due to geopolitical events at the time (Manhattan
        project being an outlier compared to natural evolution of technology in
        peaceful times). Ultimately, it comes down to a combination of potential
        gains and anticipated challenges. It's not rational to pursue something
        that goes against the known laws of physics, but fusion reactors are far
        from that in my opinion. It is also clear that that is a low bar for
        narrowing down to worthwhile causes, and it's a lot more challenging
        than one would conclude after a brief glance at the theoretical
        entitlement. The applied-physics and engineering challenges are amongst
        the greatest there is.
      </p>
      <p class="opinion">
        So is it worth the effort? The amount of energy that humanity can
        harness seems to be an indicator of our technological advancement, and a
        proxy indicator of human development.
        <br />
        In my opinion, if there is a technological “silver bullet” that can
        potentially help promote peace, bring about poverty reduction, tackle
        global warming, catalyse space exploration and just enable technologies
        unthinkable today: it has got to be Nuclear Fusion.

        <p class="opinion">
          The advantages I mention are based on how there's an indirect
          influence:
        </p>

        <ul class="opinion">
          <li>
            Promotion of peace by mitigating energy resource conflict, which
            usually influences most conflicts between sovereign entities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bring about poverty reduction by means of better energy equity,
            which in turn can improve living conditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tackle global warming through fossil fuel replacement with lower
            energy storage demands, better energy density, on-demand generation
            and control that most means of renewable energy generation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enable technologies that are not feasible today, largely because the
            majority of the energy sources involve limited release of energy
            released from chemical reactions. Scaling up is possible, but only
            until you hit the energy density wall.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="opinion">
          As far as scepticism goes, the one that I consider to be the litmus
          test for our evaluation is that by Lawrence Lidsky, as many of the
          arguments he made in the 80s are still valid today, and it provides
          some insight into what the expectations of the nuclear scientists in
          the day was.

          Some references to scepticism regarding feasibility of humans energy
          extraction from nuclear reactions, expressed by Rutherford, Millikan
          and Einstein are also provided. It's worth noting that some of this
          could be a disingenuous statement made deliberately to avert the
          militarisation of such technology. Sadly, if that were the intent, it
          was unsuccessful, and I suspect that they would be for harnessing the
          energy for civilian utility over militarisation.
