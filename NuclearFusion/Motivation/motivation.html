          <b>Figure:</b> Almost every human source of energy is derived
          ultimately from the sun, which runs on Fusion. Major advances to our
          civilisation on earth or beyond probably requires more than just
          sun-dependent renewable energy. (Image Source: NASA)

        There are some major concerns related to pursuing nuclear fusion for
        energy, including whether it will ever be a practically viable and
        competitive source of commercial energy. Much of this is related to
        uncertainty in the limits of practical implementation, given how we are
        far from a commercially viable nuclear fusion reactor today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leaving aside the question of how, if we can one day implement a
        commercially feasible nuclear fusion reactor within the confines of the
        physics we know today, it would accelerate human development. The main
        reasoning for that line of thinking is attributed to the abundance of
        the fuel and enormous energy density advantage over other sources of
        energy.
      </p>
      <details>
        <summary>More</summary>
        <p>
          The fuel in question can alter this reasoning. Currently, the leading
          candidate is Deuterium and Tritium (hydrogen isotopes with 2 and 3
          neutrons in the atomic nucleus respectively), for which Tritium seems
          to be rare and challenging to source. Even so, the reactor designs
          often incorporate a tritium breeding design from a more commonly
          available element (the most common scheme involving what’s essentially
          nuclear fission of a Lithium isotope using the neutron particle
          produced in the Deuterium-Tritium reaction). It is also thought that
          technology will evolve to other reactions later, which reduces this
          dependency, but that involves more uncertainty in forecasts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The energy density advantage mostly boils down to Einstein’s famous
          (E=mc^2) mass-energy equivalence, and since the mass “lost” is
          relatively high in the candidate nuclear fusion reactors, they are
          often many orders of magnitude more energy dense as a fuel compared to
          chemical reactions. For practical purposes, the density should take
          into consideration the entire reactor, which may be lower but the
          thought is that the potential entitlement is attractive to make it a
          worthwhile pursuit.

      <h3>The Author's take on it:</h3>
      <p class="opinion">
        Some of the scepticism is driven by the fact that optimism in the past
        failed to materialise, leading to the cliche declaration, "Nuclear
        Fusion is always <i>x</i> years away". I appreciate this, and it is a
        matter of fact that many of the predictions about nuclear fusion in the
        past were, in hindsight, hopelessly unrealistic. There are also a great
        many technological, commercial and political challenges today, some of
        which seem challenging enough for some veterans in the field to conclude
        that it's a lost cause.
      </p>
      <p class="opinion">
        It may very well be a lost cause, but I'm not convinced yet that
        "Argument from Authority" settles the matter. The field of nuclear
        science has witnessed this before, with Rutherford and Millikan,
        pioneers in the field, who went on the express harsh scepticism about
        atomic energy ever being harnessed by humans. It did not take long for
        them to be proven wrong, but that was likely due to geopolitical events
        at the time (Manhattan project being an outlier compared to natural
        evolution of technology in peaceful times). Ultimately, it comes down to
        a combination of potential gains and anticipated challenges. It's not
        rational to pursue something that goes against the known laws of
        physics, but fusion reactors are far from that in my opinion. It is also
        clear that that is a low bar for narrowing down to worthwhile causes,
        and it's a lot more challenging than one would conclude after a brief
        glance at the theoretical entitlement. The applied-physics and
        engineering challenges are amongst the greatest there is.
      </p>
      <p class="opinion">
        So is it worth the effort? The amount of energy that humanity can
        harness seems to be an indicator of our technological advancement, and a
        proxy indicator of human development.
        <br />
        In my opinion, if there is a technological “silver bullet” that can
        potentially help promote peace, bring about poverty reduction, tackle
        global warming, catalyse space exploration and just enable technologies
        unthinkable today: it has got to be Nuclear Fusion.

        <p class="opinion">
          The advantages I mention are based on how there's an indirect
          influence:
        </p>

        <ul class="opinion">
          <li>
            Promotion of peace by mitigating energy resource conflict, which
            usually influences most conflicts between sovereign entities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bring about poverty reduction by means of better energy equity,
            which in turn can improve living conditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tackle global warming through fossil fuel replacement with lower
            energy storage demands, better energy density, on-demand generation
            and control that most means of renewable energy generation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enable technologies that are not feasible today, largely because the
            majority of the energy sources involve limited release of energy
            released from chemical reactions. Scaling up is possible, but only
            until you hit the energy density wall.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="opinion">
          Finally, as far as criticism goes, the one that I consider to be the
          litmus test for our evaluation is that by Lawrence Lidsky[1][2], as
          many of the arguments he made in the 80s are still valid today, and it
          provides some insight into what the expectations of the nuclear
          scientists in the day was.
