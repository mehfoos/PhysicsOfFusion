      <h1>Fusion Reactions</h1>
      <h2>Nuclear Reactions</h2>
      <p>
        A nuclear reaction is a process that results in a transformation of an
        atomic nucleus (or nuclei). The process is initiated with reactants
        including at least one nucleus and may also include subatomic
        particle(s). The mass difference between the reactants and the products
        is balanced by energy as per mass-energy equivalence relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a typical reaction considered for energy release, we have:
        $$Reactants \rightarrow Products + Energy $$
      </p>
      <p>
        Where, the energy released is related to mass difference as ('<i>c</i>'
        denotes speed of light):
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">
        $${Energy} = \left({Mass}_{Products} - {Mass}_{Reactants}\right)\cdot
        c^2 $$
      </p>
      <p>
        The release of energy only applies for exothermic reactions. For
        endothermic reactions, energy is absorbed (products heavier than
        reactants).
      </p>

          <b>Number of reactants</b> considered is usually restricted to two
          since reactions involving more reactants are probably rare.
          Furthermore, it <i>may</i> be inconsequential if it can be treated as
          temporally successive reactions, like the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_alpha_process"
            >triple alpha process</a
          >.

          relationship).

        <p>
          <b>Comparison to chemical reactions:</b> In comparison to a chemical
          reaction, which involves redistribution of electrons with no change to
          the primary element atoms, the difference in nuclear reaction is that
          it involves transformation of these elements (or at least
          transformation of a nuclide). The fundamental force involved is
          electromagnetic in chemical reactions while it is nuclear in nuclear
          reactions (much stronger, but acts over short range). This is
          responsible for the difference in energies involved typically
          differing by orders of magnitude.

      <h2>Nuclear Fusion Reaction</h2>
      <p>
        "Nuclear fusion is the process by which two light atomic nuclei combine
        to form a single heavier one while releasing massive amounts of energy."

        <p class="opinion">
          It's worth noting that while most definitions focus on light atom
          nuclei as reactants, fusion with heavier atoms are not necessarily
          impossible, but they are not helpful for energy release for reasons
          that will be covered in the section on Binding Energy.

      <p>
        The nucleons in an atom are held together (or bound together) due to
        “strong nuclear force”. These forces act in a non-linear fashion
        compared to electromagnetic or gravitational forces. In the context of
        nuclear reactions, these forces dominate when the reactants are in close
        proximity (in the order of femtometre: 10<sup>-15</sup> metre, which is
        the order of magnitude of nuclear diameters).
      </p>
      <p>
        For nuclear reactants that are electrically charged (positive, if
        involving protons in nuclei, as is the case for nuclear fusion
        reactions), this poses a problem, as the electromagnetic forces lead to
        a repulsive force that needs to be overcome. This, as explained later,
        is one of the great challenges to initiating fusion reactions.

          There are other nuclear reactions, like
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_capture"
            >"neutron capture"</a
          >, that involves a neutral reactant such that this repulsive
          electromagnetic force is not a concern.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's also worth noting that the phenomenon of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling"
            >quantum mechanical tunnelling</a
          >
          helps with overcoming the electromagnetic force barriers in achieving
          thermonuclear fusion in stars.
