      <h2 style="font-size: xx-large">Hello There!</h2>
      <p>
        This website presents information on some of key concepts related to
        Nuclear Fusion. The focus is specifically on topics relevant for
        realising a commercially feasible nuclear fusions reactor.
      </p>
      <h2>Intent</h2>
      <p>
        The desired outcome of the content here is to inspire readers to
        contribute to the field. While there are many excellent resources on
        these topics (some of which are heavily referenced here), this website
        presents the topics with the goal of bridging the gap between shallower
        popular science coverage of the topic and the hard academic
        publications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another intent of this effort is a more personal one: to help me better
        understand the topics myself, by presenting it to others (<i
          >Learning by teaching</i
        >). For scientific or engineering challenges, I try to approach the
        topic from first principles where I can, and then cover some branches
        for the “what-if”/“how about” scenarios, to explore alternate approaches
        for solving a problem.
      </p>

        <h2>Website layout and implementation</h2>
        <h3>Navigation Links</h3>
        <p>
          The navigation links at the top take you to the home-page for the
          topics. The content is arranged in a hierarchical manner (tree),
          generally, so the navigation links below should help guide with
          intended flow of content consumption. The "Previous" and "Next"
          navigates through topics at the same level of hierarchy (skips over
          detailed sub-sections), while "Up" allows to navigate up the
          hierarchy. However, this is a subjective preference, and you can use
          the table of contents to serve you the way you desire. There may be
          multiple tables of contents, where the hierarchy is arranged
          differently (categorised perhaps by areas of physics, reliability of
          information, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          The vast majority of the website content is just html and css, with
          the intent to widen reach and minimise distractions from the content.
          Calculators and scripts may be present on certain pages, for
          demonstration or educational purposes.
        </p>
        <h3>Font Style:</h3>
        You can usually distinguish between conventionally accepted information
        and the author's annotations/opinion/speculation by checking the
        references or links. Some of the content is explicitly marked with
        different font styles to help distinguish between the two.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Derived from a collection of authoritative sources and conveying
            conventionally accepted information.
          </li>
          <li class="opinion">
            The author&rsquo;s subjective opinions, newly published research or
            content with low confidence on accuracy.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Collapsible Sections:</h3>
        <p>
          There may be collapsible sections that provide more details on a
          topic. The intent here is to provide the reader with the choice of
          abstraction of detail. Detailed information, including any
          mathematical equations and links to related content are generally
          included in collapsible sections.

      <p>
        I am the sole maintainer of this website, and I do this as a personal
        hobby. I do not have expertise in all the content on this website and
        therefore misinterpretations and mistakes are likely to eventually find
        its way here. I hope that the citations provided can help review the
        validity of the content. It may, however, be of some reassurance to know
        that the author has basic qualifications to cover the matter:
      </p>
      <p>
        I work as an engineer in the automotive and transport industry, helping
        transition us away from fossil-fuel dependent powertrain solutions. My
        academic qualifications include a Masters in Mechatronics Engineering
        (MEng) and Fusion Energy (MSc physics). This does not eliminate the
        possibility of misinterpretations, gaps in knowledge or unintentional
        errors, so please do contact me in case you notice any issues with the
        content.
