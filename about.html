      <h2>Hello There!</h2>
      <p>
        This website presents information on some of the key concepts related to
        Nuclear Fusion. The focus is on topics relevant to realising a
        commercially feasible nuclear fusion reactor.
      </p>
      <p>
        The content here aims to inspire readers to contribute to the field of
        nuclear fusion. While there are many excellent resources on these topics
        (some of which are heavily referenced here), this website presents
        topics to bridge the gap between popular science and academic coverage
        of the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another intent of this effort is a more personal one: to help me better
        understand the topics myself, by presenting them to others (<i
          >Learning by teaching</i
        >). For scientific or engineering challenges, I try to approach the
        concepts from first principles where I can, and then cover some branches
        for the “what-if”/“how about” scenarios, to explore alternate approaches
        to solving a problem.
      </p>
      <br />

        and correct, we make no representations or warranties of any kind,

        <h2>Website layout and implementation</h2>
        <h3>Navigation Links</h3>
        <p>
          The navigation links at the top take you to the home page for the
          topics. The content is generally arranged in a hierarchical manner
          (tree), so the navigation links below should help guide with the
          intended flow of content consumption. The "Previous" and "Next"
          navigate through topics at the same level of hierarchy (skips over
          detailed sub-sections), while "Up" allows navigation up the hierarchy.
          However, this is a subjective preference, and you can use the table of
          contents to serve you the way you desire. There may be multiple tables
          of contents, where the hierarchy is arranged differently (categorised
          perhaps by areas of physics, reliability of information, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          The vast majority of the website content is just html and css, with
          the intent to widen reach and minimise distractions from the content.
          Calculators and scripts may be present on certain pages, for
          demonstration or educational purposes.
        </p>
        <h3>Font Style:</h3>
        You can usually distinguish between the uncontroversial, conventionally
        accepted information and the author's annotations/opinion/speculation by
        checking the references or links. Some of the content is explicitly
        marked with different font styles to help distinguish between the two.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Uncontroversial; may be derived from a collection of authoritative
            sources and convey conventionally accepted information.
          </li>
          <li class="opinion">
            The author&rsquo;s subjective opinions, newly published research or
            content with low confidence in accuracy.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Collapsible Sections:</h3>
        <p>
          There may be collapsible sections that provide more details on a
          topic. The intent here is to provide the reader with the choice of
          abstraction of detail. Detailed information, including any
          mathematical equations and links to related content, is generally
          included in collapsible sections.

        <p>
          I am the sole maintainer of this website, and I do this as a personal
          hobby. I do not have expertise in all the content on this website, and
          therefore, misinterpretations and mistakes are likely to eventually
          find its way here. I hope that the citations provided can help review
          the validity of the content. It may, however, be of some reassurance
          to know that the author has some basic qualifications to cover the
          matter:
        </p>
        <p>
          I work as an engineer in the automotive and transport industry,
          helping transition us away from fossil-fuel dependent powertrain
          solutions. My academic qualifications include a Master's in
          Mechatronics Engineering (MEng) and Fusion Energy (MSc physics). This
          does not eliminate the possibility of misinterpretations, gaps in
          knowledge or unintentional errors, so please do contact me in case you
          notice any issues with the content.
