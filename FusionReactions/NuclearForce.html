      <h1>Nuclear Force</h1>
      <p>
        In the context of nuclear fusion energy, the <i>nuclear force</i> refers
        to the short range force that binds the nucleons in atomic nucleus
        together. This allows the "like" charged protons (positive charge) to be
        tightly bound to the atomic nuclei, overcoming the electromagnetic
        Coulomb forces that would act to repel these particles.
      </p>

          Figure: The Nuclear force (residual strong force) is shown in red (a)
          and blue (b), and the Coulomb force is shown in black (c), varying
          with distance between the nucleons.

      <p>
        The strength of this residual force varies with the separating distance
        between nuclei. It is repulsive at very low separation distances between
        nuclei (same as the Coulomb force), but attractive at higher distances
        (opposite direction to the Coulomb force). The magnitude of the force
        decays to a negligible amount as the distance increases, and Coulomb
        forces dominate at longer distances. This also contributes to the
        stability of large atoms being poorer than smaller atoms, but there are
        nuances to this, as covered in the section on Binding energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, the Coulomb forces dominate over the long range compared to
        the Nuclear force and vice versa.
      </p>
      <h2>Origin of the nuclear force:</h2>
      <p class="opinion">
        While this level of abstraction may be sufficient for studying the
        physics of nuclear fusion with the aim of commercial energy generation,
        the "<i>nuclear force</i>"" is in reality a manifestation of more
        fundamental forces and subatomic particle interactions.
      </p>
      <p class="opinion">
        The protons and neutrons of a nucleus are, in turn, composed of more
        fundamental particles called "<i>quarks</i>"". The neutron is made of
        one "Up" quark and two "Down" quarks. The proton is made of two
        "<i>Up</i>" quarks and one "<i>Down</i>" quark. The force, which helps
        bind quarks together, is one of the four fundamental forces in physics,
        and is called the “<i>strong force</i>”. This is within the domain of
        "<i>Quantum Chromodynamics</i>" (or "<i>QCD</i>"), which provides a
        framework to model gluons, the force particles mediating the
        <i>strong force</i>.
      </p>
      <p class="opinion">
        This <i>strong force</i> interaction between the quarks within a nucleon
        is dissimilar to the more intuitive forces we are used to (like
        electromagnetism or gravity), in that it acts a bit like a rubber band
        (called a quark "<i>gluon flux tube</i>"), with the force being stronger
        when the quarks mover further apart. However, when it gets too far apart
        (due to quantum fluctuations, especially when nucleons are very close
        together), a virtual particle (like a quark & anti-quark pair, but there
        are other carriers too) can be created, which is called a <i>meson</i>.
        The exchange of mesons between nucleons (proton or neutron) can be used
        to explain the phenomenon of nucleons in an atom being bound together
        (overwhelming the Coulomb force, where there are multiple protons). This
        residual effect of the underlying fundamental force (<i>strong force</i
        >) is the <i>nuclear force</i>. Therefore, the nuclear force is also
        called the "<i>residual strong force</i>" or the "<i
          >strong nuclear force</i
        >"".
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p class="opinion">
        Some sources [3] have remarked this to be analogous to a "<i
          >residual colour Van der Waals force</i
        >", similar to the "<i>Van der Waals force</i>" that describes the
        residual Coulomb forces of charge-neutral molecules. The nucleon-nucleon
        interactions are still an area of active research as they have not been
        calculated in an exact form (especially limited with unstable nuclei)
        and instead approximate approaches are used, which rely on comparisons
        to data for validation [4].
      </p>

      <p>
        This is a crude simplification, and QCD currently provides the most
        comprehensive framework that describes these interactions. See the
        videos from PBS below for an overview of QCD and the nuclear force.

        <b>Notes:</b>
        <p class="opinion">
          Subatomic physics, dealing with strong and residual strong
          interactions, requires delving deep into areas of physics where the
          author has extremely limited knowledge.
        </p>
        <p class="opinion">
          For nuclear fusion, we mostly care about how to bring nuclei close
          together to initiate nuclear reactions. We abstract away the how and
          why of certain reactions having a higher probability of occurrence
          than the others, and just consider that to be a fact available as a
          starting point. Are we missing some valuable insights that can
          accelerate nuclear fusion development? I suspect not, but it is an
          area I may return to in the future.
