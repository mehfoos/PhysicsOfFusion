      <h1>Nuclear Force</h1>
      <p>
        In the context of nuclear fusion energy, the <i>nuclear force</i> refers
        to the short range force that binds the nucleons in atomic nucleus
        together. This allows the "like" charged protons (positive charge) to be
        tightly bound to the atomic nuclei, overcoming the electromagnetic
        Coulomb forces that would act to repel these particles.
      </p>

          Figure: The Nuclear force (residual strong force) is shown in red and
          the Coulomb force is shown in black, varying with distance between the

      <p>
        The strength of this residual force varies with separating distance
        between nuclei. It is repulsive at very low separation distances between
        nuclei (same as Coulomb force), but attractive at higher distances
        (opposite direction to the Coulomb force). The magnitude of the force
        decays to a negligible amount as the distance increases, and Coulomb
        forces dominate at those distances. This also contributes to the
        stability of large atoms being poorer than smaller atoms, but there are
        nuances to this detailed in the section on Binding energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, the Coulombic forces dominate over the long range compared to
        the Nuclear force and vice-versa.

      <h2>Origin of the nuclear force:</h2>
      <p>
        While this level of abstraction may be sufficient for studying the
        physics of nuclear fusion with the aim of commercial energy generation,
        this <i>nuclear force</i> is in reality a manifestation of more
        fundamental forces and subatomic particles. The protons and neutrons of
        a nucleus are in turn composed of more fundamental particles called
        <i>quarks</i>. The neutron is made of one "Up" quark and two "Down"
        quarks. The proton is made of two "<i>Up</i>" quarks and one
        "<i>Down</i>" quark. This force, holding quarks together, is possible
        through the mediation of force particles called <i>gluons</i>. The name
        of this force is ental force called the <i>strong force</i>. It is one
        of the four fundamental forces in physics. It acts between the
        elementary particles, quarks, to form subatomic particles such as
        protons and neutrons. Between nucleons, the exchange of <i>mesons</i> is
        used as a model to explain the force holding them together, which is a
        residual force from the strong force interaction. Therefore, the nuclear
        force is also called <i>residual strong force</i>.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p class="opinion">
        The gluons in the protons and neutrons help bind the quarks together,
        with colour charges (within the domain of
        <i>Quantum Chromodynamics</i> or QCD) being the mechanism of interaction
        for gluons mediating the strong force. The exchange of gluons help bind
        the quarks. This strong force interaction between quarks within a
        nucleon is dissimilar to more intuitive forces we are used to (like
        electromagnetism or gravity), in that it acts a bit like a rubber band
        (called a quark "<i>gluon flux tube</i>"), with the force being stronger
        when the quarks mover further apart. However, when it gets too far apart
        (due to quantum fluctuations, especially when nucleons are very close
        together), like a quark & anti-quark pair can be created (there are
        other carriers too), which is called a <i>meson</i>. The exchange of
        mesons between nucleons (proton or neutron) is what leads to the
        phenomenon of <i>residual strong force</i> (or
        <i>strong nuclear force</i>) in certain textbooks, or what we
        simplistically call <i>nuclear force</i> in the context of nuclear
        fusion. Some physicists [3] have remarked this to be analogous to a
        residual colour (<i>colour charge</i> property of quarks and gluons) Van
        der Waals force, similar to the Van der Waals force that describes the
        residual Coulomb forces of charge-neutral molecules.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, this is a crude simplification, and QCD provides a more
        comprehensive framework that describes these interactions.
